Got my heart set on destruction
Going to plant a bomb inside my mind
Filled with passion, hope and resistance
Take it to the streets this time
Going to steal the language of power
The power of these words are ours
No rhetorical blackmail to make us convey
That, baby, theres no other way

Got my heart set on destruction
Of the more Bakuninesque kind
Tear it down to built something new up
Work myself all wet this time
Going to gather my brothers and sisters
Together we will organize
The biggest festival of the history
The biggest party of our lives

Yeah, I'm gonna give you some news
I've got the insurrection blues
Yeah, I'm gonna give you some news
I've got the insurrection blues
Yeah, I'm gonna give you some news
I've got the insurrection blues
Yeah, I'm gonna give you some news
I've got the insurrection blues

Got my heart set on destruction

Yeah, I'm gonna give you some news
I've got the insurrection blues
Yeah, I'm gonna give you some news
I've got the insurrection blues
Yeah, I'm gonna give you some news
I've got the insurrection blues
Yeah, I'm gonna give you some news
I've got the insurrection blues

You and me, the conspiracy
You and me, the conspiracy
You and me, the conspiracy
