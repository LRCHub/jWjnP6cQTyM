[00:07.29] Ready, steady, can't hold me back
[00:10.26] Ready, steady, give me good luck
[00:13.25] Ready, steady, never look back
[00:16.94] Let's get started ready, steady, go!
[00:34.94] 
[00:33.64] Everything is blurring before me
[00:36.95] Scenery is blowing on past me
[00:39.69] But I won't let it sway my aim
[00:43.35] I'll keep my eyes ahead, on my destination
[01:04.35] 
[00:46.92] A map I can't depend on is useless
[00:50.37] I might as well just burn it to ashes
[00:53.02] The answer's buried somewhere deep
[00:56.33] I gotta find the truth, with my own two hands
[01:18.83] 
[00:58.95] I'm running on, (frantically)
[01:03.07] In search of what I'm missing
[01:06.07] My beating heart is pounding, nearly deafening
[01:08.70] I feel it's just a beat away from bursting
[01:29.70] 
[01:12.38] Your shouting voice, (echoing)
[01:16.32] I hear it in my memory
[01:19.32] I've wasted too much time just standing here
[01:21.78] There's not a second more to spare
[01:23.39] Ready, steady, go!
[01:32.39] 
[01:34.01] Even if I'm weary from battle
[01:36.71] Covered up in scars I will smile
[01:39.77] My soul is mine alone to keep
[01:42.73] It won't be easily taken away from me
[02:01.23] 
[01:46.76] It's beyond that hill in the distance
[01:50.02] I met you and I'm being honest
[01:53.05] I wouldn't know where to begin
[01:56.06] Like hey what would I say?
[01:57.09] I don't stand a chance!
[02:08.59] 
[01:58.78] I'm running on, (frantically)
[02:03.16] In search of what I'm missing
[02:06.18] My beating heart is pounding, nearly deafening
[02:08.87] I feel it's just a beat away from bursting
[02:29.87] 
[02:12.13] Your shouting voice, (echoing)
[02:16.42] I hear it in my memory
[02:19.45] I've wasted too much time just standing here
[02:21.75] There's not a second more to spare
[02:22.88] Ready, steady, go!
[02:31.88] 
[02:33.15] Are you ready?
[02:40.60] Ready, steady, can't hold me back
[02:43.53] Ready, steady, give me good luck
[02:46.99] Ready, steady, never look back
[02:50.24] Let's get started, ready, steady, go!
[03:08.74] 
[03:05.88] My beating heart, (running on)
[03:09.86] Under the sky we've dreamed of
[03:13.23] I can't stop my feelings crying out
[03:15.28] They're just about to overflow and drive me crazy
[03:39.78] 
[03:18.87] I'll reach you soon (hopefully soon)
[03:22.85] I swear won't be much longer
[03:26.26] The sun light's shining down across my path
[03:27.97] I think that's all the sign I need
[03:29.96] Ready, steady, go!
[03:32.96] And please trust me
